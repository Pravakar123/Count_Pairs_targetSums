# Count_Pairs_targetSums
Given an integer n &amp; an integer target, the task is to find the number of pairs with sum equal to target in the range 1 to n (including) [1 - n].  Note:- n is a positive integer  Input Format  Two lines of input  An integer n, depicting the range from 1 to n(including) An integer target, depicting the value, for which you need to find &amp; count the number pairs in the range 1 to n, whose sum is equal to target. Constraints  1 &lt;= n &lt;= 1000 0 &lt;= target &lt;= 1000 Output Format  Single line of output  Count of pairs with sum equal to target in inclusive range of 1 to n. Sample Input 0  6 5 Sample Output 0  2 Explanation 0  Since range is 1 to 6 -> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. and target value is 5, therefore count of pairs with value 5 is 2 -> {1, 4} , {2, 3}
